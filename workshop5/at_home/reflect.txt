1. The advantages of using an array of structs is that when you use parallel 
arrays and want to add one field, you must add another array. Otherwise, when 
you use array od structs you just have to declare another variable in the struct
part.
2. Because we declare our variable globally, we can use it anytime we need in
our program.
