1. The function readRecord can return the values from 0 to 5. It represents the 
number that it counts when it scans and assigns the value to each variable.
2. When opening a file in r mode, it just opens the file to read but not create
or allow to write in the file. In w mode, it just creates a new file with the
given name and write in the file. If the file is already exists, it will 
overwrite the file. In a+ mode, it creates a file if it doesn't exist, we can
also read from the file and write in the end of the same file withou overwriting
if the file exits.
3. When reading data from a file, we can open the file and write many values as
we want at one time and use it when we have to display or calculate. But in when
reading data from user input, we have to scan the value for each varible and for each 
every array.
