1. A function is a series of code for a specific task. It helps programmers 
separate a big problem into small programs. It makes program easy to use
many times and understand.
2. They helps me not to repeat coding over and over for the same task. They 
can also use for different situation (different numbers).
3. To receive data from fuction, we can use a variable that has the same type
with the fuction and let that variable equal to that function. To send data to 
function, we can define the value that we need first and the replace the 
argument with that value when we call that function.
