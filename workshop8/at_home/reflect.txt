1. When passing an array to a function by address, it means that we pass the 
address where the variable is stored but not itself. We can also change the value of address
in that function without returning.
   When passing an array to a function by value, it means that we copy the value
of the variable in the memory to the parameter in the function that we assign 
that value to. And we cannot change it unless we return that value back at the 
end of the function.
2. Because it helps us for the logic of the program. For example, in my 
workshop, I use variable "size". First in the main function, I assign it with 0
and then if I add a book, it will increase by 1 for the next time until it's
full. Finally, in both the display function and check price function, it will
help me to search and display the exactly number book i added before without any different
empty index.
3. Because in some function we don't want to change the value of the "const" 
array parameters. But in others, we want to change the value of the array 
parameters.
