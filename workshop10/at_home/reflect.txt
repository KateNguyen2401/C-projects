1. A C-style string is the same as an arrays of chars but C-style string has
a terminator element called null terminator '\0'.
2. Format string: %9[^\n]
3. Because that command compares two strings. It uses ACIS number to compare 
each character. If it's matching, it will return 0.  
4. I need at least 7 bytes to store the result.
