1.In this workshop, the most important thing that i learned is about using all
types of variables
2.because on a C standard complier, such as matrix, it can not round up the demical
itself. 
3.Casting operator is a way to make a variable of one type act like another type
for a single operation.
4.I think because it helps me know how modulus operator works and how to use it
instead of division.
