1. The arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements because 
the maximum number of days is 10. Therefore, that is not necessary to have more 
than 10 elements.

2. The advantage of using matching arrays is that we can use a single name to
represent datas that have the same type. The disadvantage is that we have to 
be careful and know clearly the number of elements in the array

3. The at home portion of this workshop is just right. Because it shows me how
to use many loops at the same time but it is not too difficult or too complex 
to use these loops.
